    <h5><a href="https://github.com/sm020402">My GitHub</a></h5>
    <p>Through my own personal projects as well as the classes I have taken 
       in university, I have gained experience using many different coding 
       languages such as Java, Python, R, C++, HTML/CSS and Racket</p>
    <h5><a href="https://github.com/sm020402/CollectionOfMemories">A Collection of Memories</a></h5>
    <p>I created this application as a way to organize songs based on when I
       listened to them most. It allows users to add songs to different folders 
       based on month. It uses JSwing to create the GUI. It also uses JSON to 
       allow users to save and load data. </p>
    <h5><a href="https://github.com/sm020402/hangman">Hangman Game</a></h5>
    <p>I created this project as a way to get more experience coding in Python, 
        and also to create a game to show off to my sister. It's a simple console 
        based game of hangman where the user plays against the computer. A 
        word is chosen from an online dictionary and the user guesses letters 
        until they get the word right or run out of guesses. </p>
    <h5>This Website!</h5>
    <p>This website is a way for me to use and experiment with HTML and CSS. 
        It is still in the works and I look forward to making more changes and
        experimenting with more code. For now, it serves as a summary of information 
        about me and my personal projects. </p>
