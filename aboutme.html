            Hi! My name is Shalini Menon. I am from Long Sault, Ontario. I attended Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School and graduated as valedictorian in 2020. I am currently attending the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I am a second-year science student majoring in Statistics. I have worked many different jobs over the past few years. I worked as a math and science tutor for high school students while in my senior year of high school. I worked as a gas station attendant at MacEwen’s Long Sault from 2019 to 2021. While this was not exactly a job I was thrilled to have, it taught me a lot about customer service and how to properly communicate with coworkers and customers. In addition, this job forced me to refine my time management skills while working both alone and with others. I worked as an organist for a local church in 2019 and also as a youth leader for the local badminton program from 2019-2020.

        <p>Outside of work, I have volunteered with many different organizations over the years while also maintaining time to pursue my own personal interests. I have been playing soccer since I was very young, and played competitively from 2012-2020. Over this time period, my team had both finished first in the East Region Soccer League and won the East Region Cup on multiple occasions. In addition, I was part of the school team that won the Eastern Ontario Secondary School Athletic Association championship and had participated in the Ontario Federation Secondary School Athletic Association championship. My interest in soccer prompted me to volunteer in the community as a youth soccer coach from the years of 2017-2020. In addition to soccer, I am also very invested in music. I have completed level 8 piano with the Royal Conservatory of Music and have performed many times in the Kinsmen Music Festival. Throughout high school, I spent a lot of time playing piano for the residents of the local hospice and senior residence homes in my hometown.  </p>
